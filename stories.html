<h2>AKSHAY SRIVATSAN</h2>
<p>"I've noticed that there is a culture among some guys in tech
which just try to exclude people who aren&rsquo;t like them in race or gender. Discouraging people from
[doing this] needs to begin when kids are in
elementary school to establish that
there isn&rsquo;t a basis for this kind of bias."</p>
<a href="Sydneyprofile.htm"><img src="Sydney.jpg" alt="Sydney"
class="center" width="400" height="400" /></a>
<h2>SYDNEY JOHNSON</h2>
<p>"There are only three black chemical engineers out of the twenty. About half of the people in chemical engineering are women,
which is good, but I&rsquo;m still learning to navigate
certain dynamics. When forming study groups, I know no one
will reach out to me. I have to be the one who says, 'Hey,
let&rsquo;s work together'.</p>
<a href="Labibprofile.htm"><img src="Labib.jpg" alt="Labib" class=
"center" width="400" height="400" /></a>
<h2>LABIB TAZWAR RAHMAN</h2>
<p>"Most of my friends, and people who are from low income
          backgrounds are mostly in my classes, but people who are
          from better backgrounds than I am are in much more
          advanced classes because they had those classes in their
          high schools. That is certainly something that has been
          challenging. The disparity in the behavior of the faculty
          or the department towards us who are taking sort of the
          low level classes compared to those who are taking high
          level classes is also something that has been
          noticeable."</p>

<h2>JESSICA QUIROZ</h2>
<p>"[Discrimination based on gender and race] is there, it is
undeniable. Like, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you its not there.
But, I mean there are people that are there for you and are going
to support you. There are resources here. It&rsquo;s not
impossible. It is going to be difficult, but it's not
impossible."</p>

<h2>JAY LIU</h2>
<p>"Hiring a diverse group of TA&rsquo;s can make all
the difference or making room for gender-non-specified designations
on forms or even as simple as asking for preferred name versus a
given name on a test so that it&rsquo;s clear how a non-binary
person or a trans person who has changed their name wants to
identify."</p>

<h2>MARTIN ALCARAZ JR.</h2>
<p>"Once I went to a talk at the Stanford School of Medicine and I
asked how it was like to combine a PhD with a potential path in
Neurosurgery, and I was told not to do it by the individual giving
the talk and I listed a few names, of white people who had done it,
and the guy laughed and asked for my background and said, 'You
can&rsquo;t do it! They can, but not you. You won&rsquo;t be able
to; chose one or the other' and I was hurt; but I was also
motivated."</p>

<h2>LAUREN ZHU</h2>
<p>"For my sophomore year summer, I did research at the University
of Edinburgh. There was definitely fewer women; my professor and most of team were men. It was intimidating, but I had
to realize that I know a lot and [should] be unafraid to step up
and let them know I&rsquo;m totally capable."</p>
<a href="Fabianprofile.htm"><img src="Fabian.jpg" alt="Fabian"
class="center" width="400" height="400" /></a>
<h2>FABIAN BADILLO</h2>
<p>"I think the biggest thing [about increasing diveristy in tech]
is exposure. There&rsquo;s a lot of kids who may not know what
engineering is like or just know the stigma that engineering is
hard. But if you can expose somebody to how fun it is, they&rsquo;ll be motivated to learn more and put in the
effort to succeed in the program."</p>
<a href="Katherineprofile.htm"><img src="Katherine.jpg" alt=

<h2>KATHERINE WAISSBLUTH</h2>
<p>"I was never silent about [responding to gendered commentary].
That's another reason why those classes were kind of a toxic
environment for me. It would&rsquo;ve been better for my
social life to shut up and take it. But, I couldn&rsquo;t shut up
and take it. So then, there was even more tension in the
classroom.&rdquo;</p>
