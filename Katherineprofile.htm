      <strong>Katherine Waissbluth</strong> is a freshman from
      Kings Mills, Ohio considering a major in CS+X with a

      <br>
      <strong>Major</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am really undecided about what I want to do after
      college, but I know that I love learning English and I love
      learning Computer Science, so I was like I&rsquo;ll just
      study what I know I like right now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Career aspirations</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pretty flexible right now. I cannot see myself
      sitting at a desk writing code all day, but I am definitely
      super interested in ending up in the Tech industry in some
      way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Personal experiences</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On campus, I do not know if I have seen [race or
      gender discrimination] yet. Just because I haven&rsquo;t even
      been here two months, but I am sure it&rsquo;s there.
      It&rsquo;s everywhere.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;At my high school, all the STEM classes that I was in
      - like I took Engineering 1, Engineering 2, AP Computer
      Science, BC Calc - it was usually me, maybe one or two other
      girls and like thirty guys, which was a pretty toxic
      environment to learn in. I kept thinking what&rsquo;s that
      going to be like at Stanford - how is that going to
      change?&rdquo; &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s just a stigma
      around women in stem. Of course it&rsquo;s not something
      you&rsquo;re supposed to pursue or something girls are
      supposed to be good at. And then, at my school especially
      because there was a group of guys who took all those classes,
      and it was a toxic group to be around especially as a woman.
      In my CS, or calc, or engineering class we would have group
      work. And no one wants a girl in their group. Like, if I have
      a question or want to answer a question, my answer is not
      valid or respected or paid attention to.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I think of course I&rsquo;ve been through that, my
      high school was super conservative. It was no big deal for
      anyone to say women can&rsquo;t do this, women can&rsquo;t do
      that, like girls are stupid, get back in the kitchen. Every
      day, no one even thought a thing about it.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I was never silent about [responding to gendered
      commentary]. That&rsquo;s another reason why those classes
      were kind of a toxic environment for me because like it
      would&rsquo;ve been better for my social life to shut up and
      take it. But, I couldn&rsquo;t shut up and take it. So then,
      there was even more tension in the classroom.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I think that it's definitely the people [that makes
      STEM at Stanford accepting]. I haven&rsquo;t seen the
      university go out of their way to encourage women in STEM. I
      think the Women in Computer Science group on campus is a
      really great resource, but the university themselves, I
      haven&rsquo;t seen them trying to address the problem. I
      think that the fact that the students here are usually so
      great about it is sort of a drastic difference from where I
      went to high school.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I do see a lot of diversity in CS106A, but I think as
      I start to get into higher CS classes, it will start to
      debalance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Plans to take action</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that being a successful woman in tech is a
      goal, in order to be a role model for other women. Of course,
      if I could end up on some sort of board or some sort of
      political front to help close the wage gap and to set actual
      standard for making sure women are included in the tech
      industry, that would be amazing.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I think that Stanford itself just needs to be more,
      have a bigger conversation about it. Like, they facilitated
      the Beyond: Sex Ed at NSO, but then there was nothing about
      diversity on campus or diversity in STEM, like gender
      equality kind of a thing. You can see that they are trying to
      start a conversation in some areas, but not in
      others.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I think just recognizing that there is always more to
      learn and experiences you don't know about. I think that it
      would be good for a lot of the guys in my dorm or in my
      classes to just like keep in mind that they don&rsquo;t
      understand the struggles of a woman in STEM. Or, even myself,
      I&rsquo;m sure there are women who have struggled more than
      me. I think that it is easy to be at Stanford and think
      &ldquo;oh I know everything&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am so
      woke&rdquo; kind of a thing, but it&rsquo;s more important to
      have a mindset of always to be learning.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I really want to make computer science and STEM in
      general more accessible to women and work to end the stigma
      around being a woman in CS. I think that the best way to do
      this is to be a confident woman in CS, which is what I am
      going to try to do.&rdquo; &ldquo;Computer Science was super
      intimidating because, it is going to sound really weird, but
      I hate computers. I hate technology. I am so not intuitive
      with it. But CS is more about problem solving and logic
      solving and not even about, I mean it&rsquo;s about
      computers, but it&rsquo;s so much more about the way that you
      think. And so I was super discouraged from taking CS in high
      school because I didn&rsquo;t understand it. But, I went out
      on a whim and took it. It felt so good to be at the top of my
      class and show that the test scores don&rsquo;t lie at all -
      all of these guys were like &ldquo;what the heck&rdquo;. And
      some of them, I really felt like I changed their perspective
      of women in STEM. And it does feel so good to work so hard at
      something and see that you are changing people&rsquo;s
      perspectives. It can happen.&rdquo;
