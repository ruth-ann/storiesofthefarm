  style="padding: 0 15px; float:left;" />

  <h2><strong>Labib Tazwar Rahman</strong> (he/him) is a sophomore from Bangladesh
  majoring in physics with a potential minor in CS.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Passion for STEM</strong></h2>

  <p>"It mostly started from the get-go, just being able to open different devices in the
  home, trying to disassemble and then reassemble things was really fun. So breaking
  things down, learning their inner workings and then trying to understand what goes in
  the decision process of making any product or any tool was something that really
  fascinated me. So I would say childhood. My grandfather, he was a very hands-on guy, so
  he used to fix electronic devices at home. He used to do everything on his own so that
  also gave me a tendency to just try and fix things on my own.&rdquo;<br />
  <br />
  "I started taking classes related to STEM basically in high school, and I was
  particularly interested in math and physics because I really wanted to understand the
  world and how it worked, like I really wanted to know how stars are formed, how we
  emerged, and how all the laws of physics guide our life. All of these things I thought
  were best answered in a very structured manner in classrooms, so I started taking
  physics and math classes."</p><br />

  <h2><strong>Demographics of Classes Back Home (Bangladesh)</strong></h2>

  <p>&ldquo;It was mostly fifty-fifty (gender-wise). I had been a little startled because
  in a few higher level math classes, the number of females were less than males.
  Bangladesh is a very racially homogenous country, so there were all
  Bangladeshis."<br />
  <br />
  "I think there is a gender role that plays into what STEM subjects people opt into.
  There were always way more females in biology classes. I think there&rsquo;s this
  tendency of seeing women as caregivers and that suits very nicely to the role of a
  doctor or a nurse, so more women I think were interested maybe by their environment or
  families or by themselves because of all these influences to pursue careers related to
  life sciences rather than physical sciences. In physics and chemistry classes I would
  say that there were almost equal levels of participation, but in very higher level
  classes there were more males, and in higher level biology classes there were more
  females."</p>

  <h2><strong>Transitioning to Stanford</strong></h2>

  <p>"It has been quite an interesting journey because it obviously came with its
  difficulties. There were moments where I didn&rsquo;t really understand whether I
  should really pursue this because there&rsquo;s a very small population at Stanford
  that actually studies physics contrary to what I thought. There is just peer pressure
  to study CS if someone&rsquo;s studying STEM. I think that has really gotten to me. A
  lot of my friends, have mostly diverted to CS. It also feels like a lonely battle. For
  the departments themselves, I think there is a very stark difference in the way the
  physics or math departments treat their undergrads versus how the CS department treats
  their undergrads. I think the latter is more welcoming to all levels of backgrounds,
  whereas in physics and math people who don&rsquo;t have enough background, or people
  who didn&rsquo;t have olympiad experience or didn&rsquo;t go to schools that could have
  higher advanced classes, I think are at a disadvantage at Stanford. It also seems very
  classist to me, because from the get-go there is this very big divide in people&rsquo;s
  level of comprehension and also people&rsquo;s level of understanding in physics and
  math, and that is very hard to just walk through. Most of my friends, and people who
  are from low income backgrounds are mostly in my classes, but people who are from
  better backgrounds than I am are in much more advanced classes because they had those
  classes in their high schools. That is certainly something that has been challenging.
  The disparity in the behavior of the faculty or the department towards us who are
  taking sort of the low level classes compared to those who are taking high level
  classes is also something that has been noticeable. So it has been an interesting
  journey, socially academically and administratively."<br />
  <br />
  "Within the Stanford community I think it has been very evident that there have been a
  lot of initiatives by individuals or groups of individuals to make everyone feel more
  included and that has certainly been one of the contributing factors to why I&rsquo;m
  still taking physics. If I had to fight against everything I wouldn&rsquo;t- it would
  be more convenient for me to just study CS- it also is very interesting."<br />
  <br />
  "I think there is a trend that they&rsquo;re trying to be more inclusive, they&rsquo;re
  trying to make sure that everyone has an equal footing, and also make sure that
  everyone feels that they can have a career and interest in physics. This is something
  I&rsquo;ve seen in the CS department, where they don&rsquo;t really care about what
  level you&rsquo;re starting with, and they allocate a lot of resources to all levels,
  and that is also something that is happen in particular to physics because for the
  Physics 40 Series-- there are so many resources. There are office hours everyday for a
  lot of hours and the TAs are absolutely brilliant, so I think there have certain
  structural reforms that the physics department or the math departments are taking in
  order to address the problems. More needs to be done, but I&rsquo;m very appreciative
  that they are taking newer steps to make people feel welcome."</p>

  <h2><strong>Support Groups on Campus</strong></h2>

  <p>"I don&rsquo;t know about math all that much, but for physics, there is one group
  called PUWMAS (Physics Undergraduate Women and Gender Minorities at Stanford). They are
  very active. There is also one physics student-group SUPS (Stanford University Physics
  Society). The students themselves are very very warm, they are very lovely. The
  students have also been a very big contributor to my adapting to this challenge.
  I&rsquo;ve been supported a lot by the students-- individually, and also as
  groups."</p>

  <h2><strong>Memorable Experiences in Physics</strong></h2>

  <p>I really like going to physics office hours. One thing that I have made sure that is
  constant is that from Physics 41 (Mechanics), I took Physics 43 (Electricity and
  Magnetism) and now I&rsquo;m taking Physics 45 (Light, Hear and Waves)-- across these
  three quarters, is that I have not missed a single Friday office hours. It&rsquo;s a
  very nice environment. Everyone is doing physics, and there are a lot of TAs to help.
  That is something that I really cherish, and I certainly look forward to going there
  every Friday, just solving physics problems with very helpful and lovely people."</p>

  <h2><strong>Diversity in Physics at Stanford</strong></h2>

  <p>"In terms of gender and race, the classes that I have taken have been very diverse,
  but I&rsquo;ve heard that as classes get more advanced, it&rsquo;s mostly male
  dominated. I can&rsquo;t verify that because I haven&rsquo;t taken those classes, but I
  have heard anecdotes from people who have."<br />
  <br />
  "I do think about [the diversity in classes] a lot, and I do appreciate how diverse the
  classroom setting is [in the classes I&rsquo;ve taken]. There are people of different
  gender identities, or different sexual orientations and of different races. It&rsquo;s
  a really nice environment to be in, it&rsquo;s very diverse and I really want physics
  to be as diverse. I don&rsquo;t want it to be a white male subject, I want it to be
  very inclusive of all sorts of identities."<br />
  <br />
  "I certainly applaud the diversity initiative being taken at Stanford, I&rsquo;m pretty
  sure there is always more to be done, so there are certain student groups, there are
  faculty initiated projects that have made sure that people of different identities
  which are not very dominant in physics feel more included. I think it would be good if
  those are kept going but more momentum is added, and there are more programs under
  those projects&rsquo; banner, and there are more people, more resources and more events
  allocated under that. There is not limit to how good it can be done, but I think the
  footing has already been established, it&rsquo;s just to continue progressing from
  there."</p>

  <h2><strong>Exploring the Physics Major at Stanford</strong></h2>

  <p>"Through the PUWMAS group I was talking about, I&rsquo;m going to a conference in
  Houston, so they have allocated funds for me to do so. That has been very nice. The
  physics department itself sometimes does major nights and they have faculty dinner. The
  department has a lot of stringent rules and maybe there is a lot of bureaucracy that
  goes on, but the faculty members and the professors themselves are very humble and very
  caring. If I reach out to them, they are always very helpful, they&rsquo;re always
  there to answer questions I have an resolve any confusion. They have also been very
  supportive of research. I did research this summer at SLAC (National Accelerator
  Laboratory). They gave me funding to do that, and they also gave me a lot of support,
  both in the research and also while getting to that. There have been quite a few
  factors outside of classes that have made my physics journey nice."<br />
  <br />
  "I particularly chose to do this research because my mentor was my TA for two of my
  physics classes-- an astronomy class and also mechanics. Anytime I asked him a
  question, he never answered it straight on, but he would just would keep on asking me
  small questions that could lead me to the right answer. Although it took a lot of time
  and effort, I really enjoyed that entire process of getting the answer on my own, so I
  thought getting to learn or do research would be a very interesting and enlightening
  experience. It certainly has lived up to that expectation of mine."<br />
  <br />
  "Apart from my mentor, my professor, the entire lab, they have been very very warm,
  very welcoming, very fun-loving. We had nitrogen ice-cream sometimes. We celebrated
  everyone&rsquo;s birthday in the lab. We always ate together at picnic tables. The
  environment in the lab was very warm and welcoming to someone like me."</p>

  <h2><strong>Continued Drive to Pursue Physics</strong></h2>

  <p>"I really like physics a lot, and I have liked physics for a big fraction of my
  life. I really want to know more physics. I&rsquo;m not satisfied yet. It is that drive
  that motivated me to be in physics, and I think there are certainly a lot of new areas
  to explore, so I&rsquo;m still going strong in learning."</p>

  <h2><strong>Career Aspirations After Stanford, Perceptions of Silicon
  Valley</strong></h2>

  <p>"The dominant one is to continue being at school, so just to go to grad school, and
  to see where I go from there."<br />
  <br />
  "I would certainly want to have a taste of how it [Silicon Valley] is, I&rsquo;m not
  sure if that is something that I&rsquo;d want to do permanently, but it would be very
  interesting taking a summer off from physics or maybe a year working in industry just
  to get a flavor of how that is. I know Silicon Valley has heavy immigrant influence.
  People I know who work in Silicon Valley have mostly been international students. From
  their perspectives I have heard that it&rsquo;s quite inclusive. I am pretty aware of
  the various sorts of hidden and also sometimes explicit discrimination done against
  different races, nationalities, genders and sexual orientations, but I think that it is
  certainly better in terms of inclusiveness than a lot of other non-tech industries that
  probably have not had as much diversity as Silicon Valley."</p>
