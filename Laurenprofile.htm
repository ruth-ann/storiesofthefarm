  <h2><strong>Lauren Zhu</strong> (she/her) is a junior from San Diego
  majoring in Computer Science in the artificial intelligence track
  and is the co-president of Women in CS.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Interest in CS</strong></h2>

  <p>&ldquo;Growing up, I didn&rsquo;t necessarily want to do CS
  and didn&rsquo;t know anything about it. My parents are both CS
  people and seeing them sit in front of a computer all day
  wasn&rsquo;t something I was interested in. However, I came into
  Stanford with an open mind and after I took 106A, I found it
  engaging and exciting. CS is an interesting way to apply logic
  and problems solving, and it&rsquo;s cool to see them real
  time.&rdquo;<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;I am currently in the AI track. I want to work on
  something that&rsquo;s really impactful, new and
  innovative.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><strong>Industry Experiences</strong></h2>

  <p>&ldquo;For my freshman year summer, I interned at Qualcomm,
  working in the computer vision team. There were a lot of women on
  the team, and I really enjoyed that, as it was a very welcoming
  space, and I didn&rsquo;t feel intimidated at all. For my
  sophomore year summer, I did research at the University of
  Edinburgh. There was definitely fewer women; my professor as well
  as most of team was men. It was more intimidating, but I had to
  realize that I know a lot and I have to be unafraid to step up
  and let them know I&rsquo;m totally capable. I don&rsquo;t feel
  hindered by being a minority in CS but am actually empowered by
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><strong>Diversity in Tech</strong></h2>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve had personal experience
  with race or gender discrimination but as president of [Women in
  CS] (WiCS), I definitely hear a lot about it. This year, I think
  that WiCS will focus our attention on creating awareness about
  [gender discrimination] and attempt to mitigate the effects. We
  want to introduce more panels with women who are higher up in the
  field and have had [these sorts of] experiences. For example, one
  person suggested a negotiation workshop to help [women stand up]
  for themselves and to emphasize their own worth.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><strong>Increasing Diversity in Tech</strong></h2>

  <p>&ldquo;For Stanford, a lot of it is rooted within the CS
  department and organizations like WiCS which are trying to focus
  attention on supporting the broader community. The CS department
  is also trying to focus on promoting diversity within department
  and faculty.&rdquo; &ldquo;For industry, it is important to know
  that this is an issue that&rsquo;s systemic within companies that
  need to be addressed. Many companies do have diversity groups
  which can be powerful and really important. Ultimately,
  it&rsquo;s up to management of company to focus attention of
  these issues to be solved.&rdquo;</p>
