<h1>MARTIN ALCARAZ JR.</h1>
<img src="Martin.jpeg" alt="Martin" width="500" height="500" style=

<h2><strong>Martin Alcaraz Jr.</strong> (he/him) is a third year
Bioengineering and premed undergrad at Stanford University.<br>
<br>
<strong>Major</strong></h2>
<p>"I decided to declare my major because I was always attracted to
biology and the human genome, and I accredit this interest to my
mamacita bella! Ever since I was a little kid, she forced me to
watch documentaries, and this included things like the discovery of
penicillin, the cell, etc., and I absolutely hated it them. I
remember my mom forcing me to watch this and her rational being
that I need to be educated so that I do not work in a tortilla
factory or McDonalds or Bakery like her, and I remember crying
about it. I remember she made me watch Discovery Health, like
Untold Stories of the E.R. and Dr. G: Medical Examiner, and soon I
fell in love with it and I am forever thankful that she made me
watch it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Career</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I aspire to be a neurosurgeon and a neuroengineer &ndash;
I guess that is also one of the reasons that I picked to major in
Bioengineering. With regards to becoming a neuroengineer, I am very
interested in spinal cord injury recovery on the cellular and
molecular level &ndash; that&rsquo;s a part of one of the labs that
I am a part of at Stanford. I am also interested in working with
brain tumors and brain surgeries for the fact that I had a middle
school teacher who had a tumor and her entire right side became
paralyzed and everyone bullied her; I know, that&rsquo;s awful.
Students would pick on her and tease her &ndash; I went to a bad
middle school &ndash; but I empathized with her. I got to know her
story and I became so interested in brain tumors and the whole
process of removing them and treating patients with brain injuries.
Furthermore, I just love the brain and it hurts me when I see
people who are affected and cannot control the outcomes when they
have brain injury &ndash; and it&rsquo;s pretty common in areas
that I come from because of gang fights or just everyday injuries,
and I want to make &lsquo;neurosurgeries&rsquo; readily available
to them. I know that sounds na&iuml;ve, but I am determined to do
this in the future."</p>
<h2><strong>Discrimination in STEM</strong></h2>
<p>"I know that when I sit in a STEM or Bioengineering classroom at
Stanford, I see a lot of white and white-passing individuals, that
is to say Mexicans or Latinx people who are white. I rarely see
Brown or Black people in a classroom, and furthermore I do see that
these spaces are dominated by cis-males. With regards to myself, I
often motivate myself by reminding myself of the people who came
before me and how far I have come. Specifically, with regards to
going to STEM one of my role models, who happens to be the top
neurosurgeon in the country, is Dr. Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa. His
story motivates me and pushes me to continue to move forward. You
should really look into it! It is absolutely amazing and inspiring
as he is an immigrant from Mexico who went from community college
to Cal to Harvard Med!"</p>
<h2><strong>Diversity in the Classroom</strong></h2>
<p>" Once I went to a talk at the Stanford School of Medicine and I
asked how it was like to combine a PhD with a potential path in
Neurosurgery, and I was told not to do it by the individual giving
the talk and I listed a few names, of white people who had done it,
and the guy laughed and asked for my background and said,
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it! They can, but not you. You
won&rsquo;t be able to; chose one or the other&rdquo; and I was
hurt; but I was also motivated. I don&rsquo;t know if he was
referring to my race or economic status, but &hellip; that
motivated me even more to pursue a PhD/MD. But I guess the thing
that shocked me the most was that it came from a faculty at the
medical school."</p>
