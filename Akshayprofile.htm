<h1>AKSHAY SRIVATSAN</h1>

<h2><strong>Akshay Srivatsan</strong> (he/him) is a sophomore from Palo Alto
majoring in computer science.<br>
<br>
<strong>Interest in CS</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;As a 3rd grader, I really liked playing with Legos. My
parents got a me a Lego mindstorm kit, which has a motor and things
which you can connect to a basic program. I started programming on
that and making robots drive around. I tried to teach myself
assembly in 5th grade on this robot thing, and my middle school had
a computer class in which we worked with Terapin Logo. We also
learned Pascal. In 8th grade, I found a tutorial online on how to
make an operating system, [self-learning C]. In high school, I
worked on many programs that did a lot of processing data such as a
program that generated poetry based on Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Industry Experiences and Career
Aspirations</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I worked for 3 summers at Village Tech solutions. We were
building Luma which is a computer educational system for schools in
Nepal which don&rsquo;t have power and Internet. A lot of these
students have only used a computer once in their lives, if ever.
This computer system brings SmartBoards to their school, creating
modern learning experiences to them. In computer science, one
person can do something that changes a lot of people
lives.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Originally, I wanted to work at a big company but the more
I&rsquo;ve been at Stanford, the less I feel like that&rsquo;s what
I want to do that. Stanford has the same culture as big companies,
a culture where people really value connections and often getting
at some sort of solution without thinking if it&rsquo;s optimal or
ethical. I think that nonprofits don&rsquo;t have this mentality as
much as they are more focused on helping others rather than just
getting a product shipped. In the Silicon valley though, there
aren't many nonprofits that pay a living wage. I would still
consider working at a big company just because that&rsquo;s what
everyone does... I would also consider teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Diversity in Tech</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;My high school, Menlo, [a school in the Bay Area], did
offer CS classes. It was definitely very significantly male. The
gender disparity felt noticeable at Menlo, but it&rsquo;s even more
so obvious in the classroom at Stanford.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;I feel like efforts like Girls Who Code are helpful, but
I&rsquo;ve noticed that there is a culture among some guys in tech
which just try to exclude people who aren&rsquo;t like them whether
that&rsquo;s race or gender. I think that discouraging people from
[doing this sort of thing] needs to begin when kids are in
elementary school to really establish in people&rsquo;s mind that
there isn&rsquo;t a basis for this kind of bias.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Indian males are often stereotyped as being good at things
like programming and engineering. But there is also the stereotype
that white males are good at leading teams and are the ones who
come up with the app idea while Indian males do the grunt work and
actually implement the app idea.&rdquo;</p>
