      <b>We&rsquo;re Stories of the Farm.</b>
    </h1>
    <p class="paragraphtext">
      We are here to educate, teach, and raise awareness about race
      and gender inequalities in STEM at Stanford University. As
      Stanford students, we live, breath, and see these injustices
      take place in our very own home. We decided it was time to
      speak up and address what we see with our own eyes. The
      inspiration for our project came from the classroom, Through
      close readings and discussions in Race and Gender in Silicon
      Valley, CS 80Q, we became increasingly aware of the lack of
      diversity that exists right outside the gates of The Farm, in
      Silicon Valley and technology companies. We decided to zoom
      in and talk to our peers to see the extent to which these
      problems occured on our campus. We interviewed a group of
      Stanford engineering students to hear their stories about
      their experiences in engineering here. With their permission,
      we have shared their stories with all of you - with the hope
      that their stories will inspire and enact change and
      progress. In addition, we have compiled a list of resources
      for you to browse and explore for more information. We hope
      that this project opens your eyes to inequality in tech,
      begins discussion, and enacts change in our intellectual
      space.

      My name is Ruth-Ann Armstrong and I'm a sophomore from
      Jamaica here at Stanford, majoring in CS. I write for
      Academics at The Stanford Daily, and serve as a project
      manager for BYTES (Black Youth Teams Engineering Success),
      and the Financial Officer for the Caribbean Students
      Association (CSA). Diversity and inclusion are important to
      me because everyone has talents that could be used to solve
      the world's most complex problems.

      Hi everyone! My name is Caroline Ricksen and I am a freshman
      at Stanford University interested in studying Symbolic
      Systems and a marketing intern for Stanford Women in
      Business. I am passionate about diversity in STEM because I
      truly believe that it is a field that can positively change
      the world. Any person, of any race, gender, or status, should
      have the opportunity to contribute to something so great.
