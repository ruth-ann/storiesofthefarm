      <strong>Interest in STEM</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I was always an overachiever so during that time, my math
      teacher was like oh you&rsquo;re really good at math, you
      should become an engineer. And that was when I started doing
      engineering or STEM camps for underrepresented minorities.
      That was where I gained an exposure, not within my community
      but outside of it. &rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;But my school is not known for its rigorous academics
      so our APs don&rsquo;t really translate to doing well here.
      We don&rsquo;t have engineering courses or our own STEM
      program. I know of schools near where I live in their richer
      suburbs where they do have engineering courses, a first
      robotics team, and research opps for high school students,
      but for me to get those opportunities, I had to look beyond
      my immediate school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Major</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did some more research and a pre-orientation program
      here called the Stanford Summer Engineering Academy (SSEA),
      which takes 50 incoming freshmen and exposes them to
      different fields of engineering. We got presented to
      different fields of engineering. From that, I found
      Mechanical Engineering as the closest one I liked."<br>
      <br>
      "I did an engineering course and internship over the summer
      over there but realized that Mechanical Engineering
      internships weren&rsquo;t appealing for me and that more
      design-heavy ones were more fun. After working with
      designers, I realized I didn&rsquo;t want to be a full-on
      mechanical engineer so I decided to switch to Product Design.
      "

    <h2>
      <strong>Career</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I wanted to do more product management, being in charge of a
      team that is working on a project. I won&rsquo;t be the one
      personally designing it but will be overseeing it so I do
      have enough of a design skill to see if it is a good or bad
      design. That&rsquo;s kind of where my goals are. Right now, I
      will be working as a program manager for Microsoft so that is
      cool because I will be able to apply the things I learned
      through product design, but it&rsquo;s nice that it&rsquo;s
      not limiting me to just product design-related work.""<br>
      <br>
      "I&rsquo;ll be working in a tech company so I&rsquo;ll still
      be involved in the tech scene. I don&rsquo;t see myself
      leaving it. I even see myself going back to Chicago to work
      there, and even then they&rsquo;re trying to set up their own
      Silicon Valley, doing incubators and startups and having tech
      companies."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Concerns about going into tech</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "At first I was very concerned about not getting a job. A lot
      of my peers who come in with prior experience from high
      school, I definitely saw them getting good internships right
      off the bat, so that was a concern I had going into the space
      as a whole as a full time employee."<br>
      <br>
      "After having acquired a job, I feel like everything that was
      holding me back in terms of getting a job was in my head when
      it just took the support of my community to get me to
      continue trying to get a job. In the tech scene, you
      definitely feel like somebody else will be better qualified
      than you are. "<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Classroom Representation</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "There are apparent realities that you have to accept, such
      as whenever I go into a class, it&rsquo;s almost a norm that
      I&rsquo;m the only Latino in the class. I&rsquo;m interested
      to see the gender dynamics or gender stats for PD. It feels
      dominated by white middle-class women that are designers so
      it&rsquo;s interesting because you have a group that is a
      minority as well so they are aware of what privileges they
      have. But it&rsquo;s still very much the same story that I
      don&rsquo;t see other people like me."<br>
      <br>
      "But I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever been affected
      negatively by [the lack of Latinos in PD]. It&rsquo;s more so
      something you get used to."<br>
      <br>
      "I think SSEA gave me a false image of Stanford. I was like
      Oh, wow. There&rsquo;s so many people of color here, people
      who have similar backgrounds as me, and we all are doing
      engineering. And I go to my freshman dorm and there are a
      handful of Latinos of here and a handful of other minorities.
      I go to an engineering class and it&rsquo;s like if I sit in
      the back, it&rsquo;s mostly a white-dominated space.
      It&rsquo;s mostly white dominant and some Asian. That kind of
      was a little hard to get used to freshman year, now
      it&rsquo;s whatever. Everybody&rsquo;s just another ME or PD
      student, but that was the biggest misconception in that yes,
      there is a good chunk of underrepresented minorities that are
      doing STEM, but they are not always at the same place at the
      same time. If they are, it&rsquo;s usually at a conference or
      club meeting."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Microaggressions</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Normally in the classroom or when we&rsquo;re working on
      homework, it&rsquo;s always related to math but there was one
      time where I was working in a group and things were a little
      bit weird. This was right before the presidential election
      when Donald Trump was being elected or when the voting was
      happening. We had a group dynamic in that we had one person
      who didn&rsquo;t see any of the negatives of having President
      Trump elected, which was very different from another class
      where everyone was minorities or first-gen. They were
      directly affected by the comments against Mexicans coming
      into the U.S., all kinds of things. There were people in that
      class that were persecuted by the comments that are made by
      our president, whereas in this group, this guy was just
      saying,&rdquo; Oh, it&rsquo;s not gonna be that bad.&rdquo;
      That&rsquo;s something that was a little bit weird because
      I&rsquo;m working on a group project and this guy thinks
      it&rsquo;s okay for people like me to be sent back even
      though we were born here and raised here. I know is not a
      direct attack on me but it was something that kind of threw
      me off at first. I was like wait...you are willing to excuse
      XYZ and everything else that our president who got elected
      was doing. But at the time, it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily too
      important for our project; the end goal was to finish our
      final project and get our grade so I was able to just get by
      and work with that person. But I don&rsquo;t think he had
      anything negative towards me. I think he was just looking at
      the general sense of why he thought the president was fit to
      be elected."

    <h2>
      <strong>Inclusivity for FLI Students</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The only thing is Product Design as a major isn&rsquo;t
      necessarily the most inclusive in terms of socioeconomic
      status, not just Product Design but some Mechanical
      Engineering classes... For the Mechanical Engineering ones,
      you might have to buy your own materials and that&rsquo;s
      where it doesn&rsquo;t become the most accessible to
      students. For a class like ME203, where you build your own
      product, I guess you are a little bit discriminated against
      because you can&rsquo;t afford to make big projects or go all
      out if you don&rsquo;t have the money to fund it. For my
      project, it cost me $5 to make that&rsquo;s because I chose
      the cheapest way of making a project. In thinking about money
      as a cost to the class, I only limited myself to a certain
      process for how to make things. Instead of learning
      everything I could do, I only learned one thing because
      that&rsquo;s all I could afford... It&rsquo;s really cool for
      people to build it but if you can&rsquo;t afford to go
      through that prototyping phase, then it kind of limits you in
      a sense."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Support</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "My friend group from SSEA, most of them are ME or did
      classes with me during my initial two years as ME. I&rsquo;m
      still taking classes with them here and there, so having that
      support group got me through the academic classes...In terms
      of PD itself, the professors are really accessible. They post
      office hours when they&rsquo;re there for, not just for
      class, so all you have to do is go, wait outside the door,
      and they&rsquo;ll be able to talk to you. We have student
      advisors as well. That&rsquo;s pretty cool to have because
      you can just email them and ask them a question, and it does
      not have that power dynamic like teacher and student."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Mentorship</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "A lot of my mentors have come through my fraternity. My
      fraternity is centered around Latino culture so we have
      alumni who have graduated since 2004 to now. It&rsquo;s good
      to have them because a lot of them have been mechanical
      engineers and have gone into program management so it has
      been pretty good just asking them about their career path and
      things they did to get to that point."<br>
      <br>
      "Another neat thing is that a nickname that somebody has
      given me is Father of East Aurora. East Aurora is where
      I&rsquo;m from, and I was the first one from my high school
      to get in. Since then, we&rsquo;ve had at least one person
      get in for the next few years... Right now, you have five
      people from my high school which is from a low income area,
      doesn&rsquo;t have the best AP classes, and is not known for
      its academics for sure. We&rsquo;re still here and I&rsquo;m
      going to be the first to graduate and I got a job at
      Microsoft. And for us, it means a lot because program manager
      is the highest position I could&rsquo;ve gotten so it
      definitely means a lot to me to know that I&rsquo;m making
      them proud."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Increasing Diversity in Tech</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I think the biggest thing is exposure. There&rsquo;s a lot
      of kids who may not know what engineering is like or just
      know the stigma that engineering is hard. But if you can
      expose somebody to how fun it is or to something they might
      like, then from there, they&rsquo;ll be motivated to learn
      more and put in the effort to succeed in the program."<br>
      <br>
      "I think there&rsquo;s a lot of things in place already to
      continue helping increase diversity. I think it&rsquo;s just
      going to take time and more growth for sure, but I can see it
      happening."
