    <h2>
      <strong>Jessica Quiroz</strong> (she/her) is a Freshman fro
      anticipating a major in Mechanical Engineering. She is a
      Freshman Intern for SOLE, with a role in SLAE.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Major</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "What drew me to the major, so my high school took a few kids
      to the SpaceX headquarters on a field trip, and it was really
      cool. We went inside and once I saw the rockets I thought:
      &ldquo;I have to work on something like this. I just fell in
      love.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;Everyone seemed like they enjoyed what they were doing
      and were passionate about it too [at SpaceX]. So, that really
      drew me to it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Career aspirations</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "SpaceX. I really want to work there. Or Tesla.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Approaching Inequality</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Being at Stanford is already kind of intimidating in a
      racial perspective, coming from me being a minority and being
      FLI here. So, I thought I would gain experience here on how
      to deal with it.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I know there will be people in the interview process
      who have bias, but I am not sure how to deal with that, since
      I cannot really change that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Experiences</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On campus, with certain groups and organizations that
      are not explicitly racist, but you can tell that they are
      bias somewhere or prejudice.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;Where I lived was pretty diverse: there were hispanic
      and black people. The neighboring city was white. We were the
      poor city and they were the rich city - so I guess that is
      called racism because of the racial hierarchy.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;[Racism on campus] is not explicit, but the looks some
      people give you or the way they act towards you are more
      rude.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>STEM at Stanford</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not a lack of [diversity in my STEM classes],
      not to be mean, but it&rsquo;s one of the lower math classes,
      it&rsquo;s Math 20, it&rsquo;s not like Math 51 or CME 100. I
      think that is because minorities tend to be in lower math
      classes because we usually come from like low income places
      with low funding. But, there is definitely inequality in the
      proportions of people."<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;Yeah, I will definitely be intimidated by [the lack of
      diversity in my future classes]. I know that there are people
      that are way smarter than me, but having them be male and
      white is also really intimidating because they have privilege
      outside of the classroom and it is kind of hard to deal with
      that. But, I have friends in my classes and later I am not
      sure if they will be in it, so it&rsquo;s hard to tell right
      now.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I am not sure if [others are aware of their implicit
      racial and gendered comments]. It is implicit for a reason
      because I don&rsquo;t think they are aware of it, but they
      should know that what they say has some impact or power."<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;No [I haven't felt discouraged from pursuing STEM].
      Maybe it&rsquo;s because I am in SOLE, Society of LatinX
      Engineers. And in that im in this thing called SLAE - Society
      of LatinA Engineers. It&rsquo;s kind of like a group where
      you support each other being in STEM.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>SOLE</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Sole I am a frosh intern. I just applied, they
      interviewed me, and I got in. But, I applied specifically to
      be a Frosh intern for SLAE. And with that I have been doing
      work. We are going to collaborate with SWE - society of women
      engineers.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;For SLE, we are thinking of bringing in high schoolers
      or going to high schools. SPecifically, working with
      minorities and females because in SOLE there are a lot of
      engineers who are minorities, but they are males. So the
      females kind of get intimidated by that. So I think that if
      we could get more girls in SLAE it will be better And with
      SWE, I haven't been to many meetings, but I Heard that they
      are not high on diversity. At least, that is what I have
      heard, So, I think we&rsquo;re working to increase diversity
      in SWE.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Personal Passion for STEM</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It started when I visited SpaceX. After that, I
      thought that I should probably do something in Engineering.
      After that, I kind of followed that path.&rdquo;<br>
      <br>
      &ldquo;I think that was the only problem at SPaceX, most
      people were male. If they were female, they were usually
      white. The people who were colored, they were like in the
      dining area or janitors or something.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Future</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know since I got into Stanford and applied as
      Mechanical Engineering, a lot of the High School Seniors I am
      friends with, or Juniors, that they are kind of like
      inspired. It gives them some hope that someone from our
      community can do it too.&rdquo;
    </p><h2><strong>Advice</strong></h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;[Discrimination based on gender and race] is there, it
      is undeniable. Like, I&rsquo;m not going to tell you its not
      there. But, I mean there are people that are there for you
      and are going to support you. There are resources here.
      It&rsquo;s not impossible. It is going to be difficult, but
      it's not impossible.&rdquo;
