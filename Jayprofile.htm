      <strong>Jay Liu</strong> (they/them) is a junior double
      majoring in Computer Science and Chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Major</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I first started taking CS and chemistry classes frosh year.
      It was right away, straight up about a whole quarter I
      enrolled in Chemistry 31A and CS106B, and ever since then
      I&rsquo;ve just been taking one CS and one Chemistry class
      basically every quarter. Both subjects just grew on me at the
      same time. And so Chem and CS appealed to me in two different
      ways, but at their core they&rsquo;re both majors that allow
      me to do a lot with my mind and create and be creative, which
      is really important to me, but also have the opportunity to
      get really, really deep in theory and science and all that is
      very interesting and exciting."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Career aspirations</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came into Stanford solid pre-med, and it&rsquo;s
      been bouncing back and forth lately about whether I am going
      to stay on that path. Right now, at least at this moment, I
      feel more drawn to going to graduate school and getting
      really deep into a chemistry field in which I could apply CS
      practices, techniques, knowledge."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Race/gender discrimination</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Gender is something that still impacts me a lot that I see
      very often. I identify as genderqueer, non-binary. I use
      they/them pronouns and so it always stands out to me like a
      lot when a form is like what gender are you? Male or female?
      And it stands out to me when specifically the questionnaire
      asks you the gender question and it&rsquo;s not clear why
      they would need that information and how they would use that
      information. Especially when they don&rsquo;t give you leeway
      to provide an alternative answer, it&rsquo;s very obvious for
      me."<br>
      <br>
      "In terms of gender microaggressions, it&rsquo;s not only
      transphobia but also just sexism at its most basic level.
      Often unfortunately, in my encounters in the CS department,
      especially during office hours, where I feel like pressure is
      high, people are stressed, and sometimes attitudes or
      demeanors get out that wouldn&rsquo;t normally get out in a
      more controlled setting. But just in a space where everyone
      is struggling to complete their assignment or understand the
      concept, it&rsquo;s very clear when someone is getting testy
      or acting arrogant or condescending towards you in
      particular, maybe because of your gender, your race, or
      anything external perceived by you. It&rsquo;s very clear
      when they&rsquo;re doing that to you and not to the next
      person they&rsquo;re talking to."<br>
      <br>
      "But there&rsquo;s also been good things that I&rsquo;ve
      noticed, especially within the CS department. Certain classes
      are very conscious about being gender inclusive. Hiring a
      diverse group of TA&rsquo;s for instance can make all the
      difference or making room for gender-non-specified
      designations on forms or even as simple as asking for
      preferred name versus a given name on a test so that
      it&rsquo;s clear how a non-binary person or a trans person
      who has changed their name wants to identify. Just like
      making things slightly easier for people in ways that you
      might not necessarily think makes a difference but in reality
      it&rsquo;s like night and day for a queer person."<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Passion for STEM</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "The thing that kept the STEM door open for me, the thing
      that didn&rsquo;t prevent it being shut all the way,
      I&rsquo;m very lucky to have had in my life is the influence
      of probably my dad&rsquo;s strongest. He is a computer
      scientist and he was first-generation immigrant to the US and
      computer science got him a pretty well-paying job, financial
      security, a family, and a house and so he was very adamant
      that I walked away in life with a skill I can fall back
      on."<br>
      <br>
      "But I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was as good or as smart as
      other people who dedicated their time 100% to STEM clearly.
      When I came to stanford, studying CS and majoring in CS
      became an option that I felt was more feasible, partly
      because the instructors in the classes I took encouraged me
      to keep doing it. I think I came in with a huge inferiority
      complex about my ability to perform in STEM, and I remember
      the first time or after the first quarter after getting an A
      in a CS class, having Keith write me an email and say
      &ldquo;Hey, you did a pretty good job here. Maybe you should
      consider keeping studying this subject,&rdquo; was definitely
      a strong factor in my decision to keep going with this."<br>
      <br>
      "I just cared that I was in this field studying these
      problems, engaging in this life, and so I declared chemistry.
      And CS came quickly after that because it still is that
      coding is still something that I really like to do. It does
      put my at peace in a way that sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to
      find in a busy life. "
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Overall High School Demographics</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I feel like I came from a more racially diverse neighborhood
      in the sense that there were white kids but also Asian kids
      and Latino kids. It was a very racially diverse place but in
      the context of high school, it didn&rsquo;t feel diverse
      because the classes I was taking only allowed me to come into
      contact with the same 20-30 people who were all relatively
      high income, white, or East Asian."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Diversity in the Classroom</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I&rsquo;m pretty sure diversity is the first thing I look
      for when I walk into a classroom. It is really important to
      me because I feel like it changes the classroom atmosphere
      and it affects the degree to which I feel like I have to make
      an extra effort to be present or assert myself in a space
      because it does require extra effort if you&rsquo;re in a
      very homogeneous room."<br>
      <br>
      In CS classes, I think CS does a better job of being diverse
      because it is such a large major and so many people are drawn
      to it and so I frequently feel that I&rsquo;m able to be in
      an environment in which I&rsquo;m not the only person of
      color, not the only queer person, not the only non-binary
      person in the room. But at the same time, it&rsquo;s a major
      that is so large that people are more inclined to think about
      class or something academic than how they&rsquo;re engaging
      with the people around them and so sometimes the importance
      of having that diversity in the room gets lost and subsumed
      in the daily grind and rush to finish that coding assignment
      you have not finished yet, whereas in chemistry, it&rsquo;s
      so small that people actually stop and talk to each other.
      It&rsquo;s more clear that people are prioritizing diversity
      in the room.

    <h2>
      <strong>Tech/STEM-related Field Aspirations?</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I want to work in a STEM-related field clearly, this is my
      major, but I&rsquo;m not an entrepreneurial type. I&rsquo;m
      not the kind of person who&rsquo;s like let&rsquo;s drill
      down and get these internships so I can go to Google when we
      graduate. I kind of just want to be in academia for as long
      as I can. It&rsquo;s also because I have the financial
      privilege to be saying this, but at the moment, making a lot
      of money in the future or right now is not as important to me
      as finding someplace where I feel at home, at peace with
      myself, and challenged and interested enough to keep engaging
      in the problems I want to be engaging in. and so prioritizing
      finding those spaces is a lot more important to me than being
      a part of any Silicon Valley culture. Honestly, it&rsquo;s
      not appealing to me at all. "

    <h2>
      <strong>Improving Diversity in Tech/STEM</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      "I guess the two things are paying attention to the little
      things and paying attention to the people. I think that in
      terms of people, role models make a huge difference. This is
      the first quarter in a chemistry class where I&rsquo;ve had a
      non-binary TA, and that has been an amazing experience for
      me. It just affected me in ways that I didn&rsquo;t think I
      could be affected, just seeing a successful queer person in
      that position made me realize that something like that is
      possible for myself."<br>
      <br>
      "It&rsquo;s just doing your best to make sure that the room
      is representative is the core thing that it boils down to.
      And in terms of the little things, I think that it&rsquo;s
      important to remember how you are affecting people even when
      you don&rsquo;t realize you&rsquo;re affecting people, even
      paying attention to how you are reacting engaging with
      someone at office hours or paying attention to how you are
      creating the forms you send out to people, how you&rsquo;re
      addressing people, paying special attention to make sure that
      you&rsquo;re using the preferred name or using the preferred
      pronouns. It&rsquo;s all the little things that you
      don&rsquo;t think add up to anything, in the grand scheme
      that actually add up to a lot."
    </p>
    <h2>
      <strong>Department Support</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      " But it&rsquo;s just nice to feel that people know who you
      are and are watching after you, and obviously in the
      classroom, having TA&rsquo;s who you feel like understand
      you, how you&rsquo;re feeling in the room, what you&rsquo;re
      dealing with on a day-to-day basis is also really
      important."<br>
      <br>
      "In CS, it&rsquo;s harder to express how I felt supported,
      probably because I haven&rsquo;t looked for that as much. I
      feel like I&rsquo;ve derived most of my support from, again,
      being in the Chemistry major, and so I felt less need to
      psychologically engage with the population in CS...I mean, CS
      has a lot of mentorship programs and there are mentorship
      programs for a lot of different forms of identity, and so if
      you want to be in contact with someone who identifies the
      same way you do and is also academically interested in the
      same things you&rsquo;re interested in, it&rsquo;s easy to
      connect with them and find them. Obviously professors and
      lecturers who reach out to you and take the time to get to
      know you, know your name, and know why you&rsquo;re here,
      that also means a lot."
