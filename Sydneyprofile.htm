  <h1>SYDNEY JOHNSON</h1><img src="Sydney.jpg" alt="Sydney" width="500" height="500"
  style="padding: 0 15px; float:left;" />

  <h2><strong>Sydney Johnson</strong> (she/her) is a junior majoring in chemical
  engineering.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Background for interest in Chemical Engineering</strong></h2>

  <p>"I got into chemical engineering maybe in my senior year of high school. I was in a
  STEM magnet program, that allowed us to do basically research, and work at hospitals
  and other types of places, wherever you want to study. We would do research projects
  and in my senior year, I was working at a manufacturing facility where they manufacture
  different types of chemicals. I was working directly under a chemical engineer and a
  lot of people on his team were also chemical engineers, and they told me about the
  flexibility of the major. Getting that industry experience and a little bit of research
  helped me get into it, and then I came here and decided to continue it. My dad also
  graduated as a chemical engineer for his undergraduate degree.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><strong>Early Mentors and Influences</strong></h2>

  <p>&ldquo;One of my mentors, who was also my physics teacher, encouraged me to apply
  for one of the science governor&rsquo;s honors program in Georgia and she helped to
  prepare me. She was also in science club. I became involved in that, worked with her
  and eventually became the vice president, and she was a mentor for me in the sense of
  finding opportunities for me in STEM. In addition, when I was a little girl, I looked
  up to Mae Jemison who was an astronaut, and I found out later that she was a chemical
  engineer who graduated from Stanford. She also graduated with African and African
  American Studies, and she&rsquo;s super awesome. I think it was a combination of all
  those things that made me want to look into STEM and engineering. I also just really
  liked math. I like solving problems. I kind of liked chemistry, but I loved math more
  and I think combining all of those things made me want to be an engineer."</p>

  <h2><strong>STEM Classes Back Home</strong></h2>

  <p>"I went to a public high school, and it was technically out of my district so I had
  to apply to get into the high school&rsquo;s program. It wasn&rsquo;t too far from me
  which wasn&rsquo;t bad, but I had to catch the bus at different spots with kids who
  were also in other programs for different schools. It was a STEM magnet program within
  the public school. So there was a public school curriculum, and there was this magnet
  curriculum that was more STEM focused, and it was considered to be more advanced and
  more fast-paced. We took biology, chemistry, math and then our sophomore year is where
  we took more science and math. In our junior year, we took the AP Calculus classes, AP
  Chemistry, AP Physics, all of that. Senior year is when I started to take multivariable
  calculus, I took advanced mathematical topics which talked about proofs and graphs,
  which was really cool to me. I also took a beginning programming class where I learned
  about html and a little bit about Java, but not a whole lot. The rest of my courses
  were pretty well taught, especially my math courses. I really liked math and it really
  helped that I had teachers who challenged me and other students."<br />
  <br />
  "In terms of demographics, there were maybe five or six black women in the program in
  my year, and there was maybe about fifty of us per year, and it was mostly white and
  Asian and a small percentage were black and Latinx students. Gender-wise, it felt
  pretty 50-50 if not 60-40 male to female. I remember in my advanced mathematical topics
  class, that&rsquo;s where I really noticed it. There were around 20 students and maybe
  three or four of us were women."<br />
  <br />
  "For me, I think as a black female student in the class, I was just kind of focused on
  my work, and I tried not to think about a lot of things externally, but I did feel
  sometimes, kind of awkward asking a question in class for instance, because I
  didn&rsquo;t want to look dumb. I think in the multivariable and advanced mathematical
  topics classes, I think I was the only black female in my class, or maybe one of two or
  three black students. Sometimes I was kind of conscious that it was a majority white
  and Asian room, but I don&rsquo;t think I felt severely conscious of my identity, I was
  just doing my work."</p>

  <h2><strong>Transition to Stanford</strong></h2>

  <p>"I&rsquo;d say for my freshman math and chemistry classes, [my high school] prepared
  me really well. For instance in CME 100, a lot of it was covered in my high school so I
  felt comfortable with the transition. I don&rsquo;t think I was used to the level of
  load for the psets, because the way my school operated for math classes was that they
  never collected homework. You were just expected to do it, and that&rsquo;s how you
  performed on the exam. It was always about accountability on your end. Here, they force
  you to do your homework and it&rsquo;s a graded category, and I think combined with
  other classes it felt a lot more rigorous. I was already comfortable with the material
  so it helped me."<br />
  <br />
  "For me, I realized that if I didn&rsquo;t have the best background knowledge in this,
  it would have been harder to navigate some of the critical thinking and problem solving
  questions. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t really test if you know the material, they test
  if you know it and you can navigate a certain scenario which is kind of difficult
  sometimes. I would say freshman year, the transition was about getting used to the pace
  of things and that it was a different type of curriculum."<br />
  <br />
  "Spring quarter, I took CME 104 and that was very different, very hard to understand. I
  had a great Additional Calculus for Engineers (ACE) teaching assistant (TA) so that
  helped. I also had organic chemistry. The first half or so of freshman year-- I
  remember emailing my high school teacher saying, 'You guys prepared me.'"</p>

  <h2><strong>Experience Doing a Chemical Engineering Major as a Black
  Woman</strong></h2>

  <p>"The content is very appealing to me, but some of the classes I&rsquo;m required to
  take don&rsquo;t interest me, because I&rsquo;m interested in a very specific vein of
  chemical engineering. I&rsquo;m interested in energy, and here they really push biology
  a lot-- I don&rsquo;t like biology at all so sometimes it&rsquo;s kind of tough in that
  sense. I do wish I hadn&rsquo;t made up my mind so soon before coming to Stanford,
  because I think it would have been good to explore other majors, or other intro
  classes. That being said, I think I probably would still end up doing chemical
  engineering. I think my experience has just been that I&rsquo;m kind of frustrated that
  a lot of the work is very theoretical and it&rsquo;s not the most practical. A lot of
  the classes aren&rsquo;t project oriented. It&rsquo;s the one of the heaviest unit
  majors in the School of Engineering to my knowledge. We have a lot of prerequisites, a
  lot of chemistry that we probably don&rsquo;t need. I&rsquo;m happy that the department
  is making changes going forward, but there are still instances where even the way they
  sequence courses, it puts people at a disadvantage if you&rsquo;re not prepared for the
  level of rigor. For instance, if you came in doing Chemistry 31A like I did as an
  incoming freshman, you would later on have to take a prerequisite course with a course
  that requires that prerequisite which is whack. I don&rsquo;t know all the dynamics,
  but I think there&rsquo;s a lot of progress to be made. I try to talk to people in the
  school of engineering and the student services people about it."<br />
  <br />
  "As a black woman here at Stanford, I am hyper-aware of who I am, where I am, and my
  identity, because people let me know (laughs). Not that I didn&rsquo;t feel it before
  in high school, but in high school I would hear my peers make jokes about black people,
  and I&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not okay, don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo; People
  would say, &ldquo;She only got into Stanford because she&rsquo;s a black woman&rdquo;
  and &ldquo;Oh, it must be nice to be a black woman these days in the college
  process&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;d think, that&rsquo;s not how it works. But back to
  Stanford, I&rsquo;m hyper aware. There are only three black chemical engineers. There
  are twenty of us. About half of the people in chemical engineering are women, which is
  good but for me, I&rsquo;m still learning to navigate certain dynamics. Even just
  forming study groups. I know no one will reach out to me. I have to be the one who
  says, &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s work together,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s build a
  group."<br />
  <br />
  "Some people have said, that we should meet up [to study], but I have to make sure that
  I follow through because they probably won&rsquo;t do it. Or the fact that I have had
  TAs that have been very condescending to me based on my personal interpretation, or
  they&rsquo;ve made fun of me for asking questions, but they won&rsquo;t do that for
  other people. Or I have had some peers try to talk over me during office hours. Even
  little things, like when professors say, &ldquo;Oh my goodness, you&rsquo;ve changed
  your hair, I thought I had a whole new student.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;m like, &ldquo;No, I
  just took my braids down.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just like little things like that--
  microaggressions."<br />
  <br />
  "That being said, I have had professors who I felt were really supportive. I have met
  great people here like Professor Will Tarpeh (Assistant Professor of Chemical
  Engineering) who graduated from Stanford. He was in Talisman, he was also chemical
  engineering, he&rsquo;s also black, he was in SBSE (Stanford Black Society for
  Engineers). He&rsquo;s been a great resource and someone to talk to. It&rsquo;s just
  kind of hard. I&rsquo;m even now learning how to ask questions without feeling dumb in
  class. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how I look to my peers at this point because I&rsquo;m
  getting the same work done, and it&rsquo;s for my understanding. Even freshman year, my
  motto was, &ldquo;Let them tell me no.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m going to ask before I tell
  myself no for some things, and that&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;m also working on.
  It&rsquo;s an interesting dynamic."<br />
  <br />
  "I try to focus on my work as much as possible because if I get too caught up
  stereotype threat or over-analyzing things, it will just be a lot to process and think
  about, when I&rsquo;m just here to be a student. Others don&rsquo;t have to worry about
  that. I need to just chill and focus on my work. I used to feel hyper-aware, but now
  I&rsquo;m trying not to care as much. I am using as many resources as I can-- going to
  office hours more and being forward with what I want to get done. I&rsquo;m not going
  to feel bad about asking a question. I used to ask the TA a question and say,
  &ldquo;sorry, but-&rdquo; and then ask, but there is really no need to apologize- this
  is their job. There are studies about women apologizing in certain contexts, and
  I&rsquo;m learning not to apologize as much anymore, because there are more dynamics at
  play."<br />
  <br />
  "I remember even in my CME 104 class during freshman year, I think it was majority
  male. It was maybe like 65-35. For one of my classes, I did a study where I looked at
  gender. I looked at the women who raised their hands and the men who raised their
  hands, and also speaking volume. I remember sitting in class, and I was taking notes
  for the class and also taking notes for the study for this other class. I noticed that
  I would hear the other girls whispering the same answer the guy would say when he
  raised his hand. Even for me, I would do the same thing where I&rsquo;d have the
  answer, but it&rsquo;s so hard to work up the courage sometimes to raise your hand
  because you just don&rsquo;t want to be wrong. Other guys aren&rsquo;t afraid to be
  wrong. Sometimes professors create this environment where they call the same people,
  and they allow them to do whatever. It&rsquo;s hard to figure out whose fault it is,
  but it makes me think that if I were a professor, I&rsquo;d be more conscious that not
  just this one person has the answer, I would actively choose other people."<br />
  <br />
  "I also notice my peers try to double or triple check my answers or over verify with
  someone else to validate my answers when working on psets. I try not to focus on it too
  much, but I do notice it."</p>

  <h2><strong>Support Networks</strong></h2>

  <p>"SBSE has provided a great network of being able to reach out to people. I remember
  when I met Ariel Reid who was a coterm when I was in my first year of chemical
  engineering. It was great talking to her. Kevin Tynes, I still talk to him to this day.
  He (17:36) was president when I was a freshman, he was also chemical engineer. When I
  was in one other student group, there was another person, the only black chemical
  female chemical engineer in her year-- Kierra Franklin. She was also in SBSE, so I had
  a chance to talk to her. Will Tarpeh has been a great resource, the Stanford Summer
  Engineering Academy (SSEA) program has been especially helpful for me, because that
  helped further my transition to Stanford even better. I got to meet professors that
  way, and Dr. Noe Lozano (Associate Dean for Diversity at the School of Engineering) was
  also a helpful resource because he organizes the whole program. So for instance, I took
  a chemical engineering faculty to lunch, Professor Thomas Jaramillo, and then I had him
  later on as a professor. It was really helpful in that way. For him, also being a
  person of color in STEM too, that&rsquo;s been a way of connection. I also work in the
  Office of Student Affairs, and so I have been able to talk with Dr. Lozano and now that
  he is retired, being able to talk to Lourdes Andrade (Director of Diversity and
  Inclusion in the School of Engineering). The whole office is full of women, which is
  really great. That&rsquo;s also a very encouraging and very welcoming environment. Dean
  Thomas Kenny (Senior Associate Dean For Student Affairs In The School Of Engineering)
  also comes into the office sometimes too, and I&rsquo;ll just talk to him about majors,
  and classes and he may ask me about my department. I feel pretty comfortable doing that
  given the connections I&rsquo;ve had."</p>

  <h2><strong>Thoughts on Creating a More Inclusive Environment</strong></h2>

  <p>"I think just listening to us is the first step. We had a symposium where is was
  nice to talk to some of the people who develop our courses. We were able to talk to
  them about the issues we&rsquo;ve had with it. I don&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re
  going to do with that information, but at least they gave us an opportunity.
  There&rsquo;s John Whitney (Student Services Specialist for Undergrads, Masters,
  Coterms, Chemical Engineering), who I think has been really helpful in publicizing a
  lot of opportunities and so was the person before him. I learned via him, who learned
  about it via Lisa Hwang who is also in the program as well about the MIT Access
  program. This program sends students to MIT to learn about their PhD programs. That was
  a really good opportunity for me to meet other people from all over the country and
  also learn about PhD programs and graduate schools. I think they&rsquo;re on their way,
  but it&rsquo;s just a process."<br />
  <br />
  "So just listening to the students and having a pulse on industry. I really want them
  to do a track system like MIT, so we don&rsquo;t have to take all the classes, we can
  just take the classes that are relevant to us."</p>

  <h2><strong>Memorable Experience in the STEM Classroom</strong></h2>

  <p>" I remember when I was in Professor Jaramillo&rsquo;s CHEMENG 100: Chemical Process
  Modeling, Dynamics, and Control class-- basically you learn how to use mathematical
  equations to model like temperature flow or concentration of a chemical. That was
  really interesting to me. I really enjoyed the class, also because I like math. I
  really like the idea of being able to take an equation, and adjust it and apply
  chemical properties to it-- like rates and reactions-- and be able to say that this is
  what a system does. I remember once 22.18 after class talking to Professor Harmio, and
  I said, &ldquo;I think I want to be a chemical engineer for sure.&rdquo; It was a
  really good moment for me."</p>

  <h2><strong>Avenues for Major Exploration</strong></h2>

  <p>"I&rsquo;m still learning how to do that, but I would say my internship with the
  Sustainability Center after my freshman year allowed me to see a different side of
  renewable energy. I was kind of interested in hydrogen fuel cells before coming to
  Stanford based on an article I read and the SSEA program. The internship allowed me to
  see more about renewable energy. It&rsquo;s funny because I learned about the
  internship via an SBSE meeting, and so I thought I should apply to it. So I applied,
  along with my other friend in SBSE, and so it was us working together with a group of
  other people. We had different majors, but they were all connected to renewable energy.
  So they included chemical engineering, materials science, human biology, civil and
  environmental engineering. We studied the factors that fall into the implementation of
  floating solar cells. So if you put it on a dam or a lake and you have floating devices
  with solar cells on them, and then also, how would you come up with a plan to implement
  a biodiesel processor at the educational forum, and being able to work in the lab and
  model what it looks like, and make our own biodiesel. We had a very small amount, but
  it was a really cool process, because although there were some STEM-y aspects to it,
  there are so many more policies and other background information that goes into it.
  Especially looking at how to store energy properly, and sending energy back to the
  grid, and how that works with public utilities, and how that works with refiners for
  biodiesels, how it&rsquo;s processed, whether it&rsquo;s economical or environmentally
  friendly. Knowing that there are so many dimensions to the work you do as an engineer,
  it made me really interested in being maybe someone in the future who is creating cool
  technology, but is also a liaison between the communities and the government. There are
  a lot of gaps between the people who make policies and those who build tech."</p>

  <h2><strong>Attraction to Energy</strong></h2>

  <p>"For me, energy is interesting because it fuels everything. You need petroleum
  engineering to get the fuel for most cars these days. For energy, there are so many
  dimensions and aspects to it. There are renewables, there is traditional, electrical. I
  was really interested in hydrogen fuel cells in particular, even water splitting
  processes where you can take water molecules and you can capture the hydrogen and use
  that to fuel cars. I&rsquo;m more interested in the idea of sustainable, clean energy,
  because it seems good for the earth, and if it&rsquo;s used in the right way, it can
  help a lot of people."</p>

  <h2><strong>Career Aspirations After Graduating</strong></h2>

  <p>"It&rsquo;s kind of tricky figuring out what to do for the future. Right now
  I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;ll probably do grad school, I&rsquo;m not sure where exactly
  or if it&rsquo;s going to end at a Master&rsquo;s or if it&rsquo;s going to end at a
  PhD.I think that I want to do grad school, maybe work in industry, then eventually get
  to the point where I&rsquo;m working as a liaison. I feel like a lot of the clean
  energy is being focused in higher income areas-- so making sure that there is
  accessible clean energy for other people, and also in even developing countries. As
  economies are progressing, there is still a lot of reliance on coal, gas and oil, which
  isn&rsquo;t bad, but as everyone is trying to find more renewable energy solutions, I
  want to make sure that it&rsquo;s more evenly distributed. I&rsquo;m not sure how
  I&rsquo;m going to get there yet, but I&rsquo;m learning as I go. I definitely want to
  work in energy, but this is what I&rsquo;m thinking now, but I know that in five years
  I may be thinking doing completely different."</p>

  <h2><strong>Thoughts on Working in Silicon Valley, and Perceptions</strong></h2>

  <p>"I&rsquo;m originally from Texas and I&rsquo;ve lived in Michigan, and my family and
  I currently live in the Atlanta area in Georgia. I like being close to family. Although
  the Bay Area has it&rsquo;s pros, I will probably be somewhere in Chicago, Atlanta or
  Houston"<br />
  <br />
  "I imagine it to be very white. I imagine people sitting at a computer all day. I know
  that there is diversity there, but it often times just doesn&rsquo;t feel inclusive and
  if there are diversity or affinity groups, it sometimes feels kind of false and
  inauthentic. That being said, every workplace has its issues, and microaggressions--
  sexism, racism-- isn&rsquo;t new to any workplace. Being here specifically around
  emerging technology, there are a lot of voices that are being left out, and that
  affects how for instance, in Airbnb, black people are staying at a house that they
  rented and the cops were called on them. So those little things. I guess I&rsquo;m
  trying to be a bit more socially conscious about the intents of companies as well
  because some things seem like they&rsquo;re doing well, but they may be supporting
  something that&rsquo;s counter-intuitive."<br />
  <br />
  "Additionally I used to mentor at a middle school. The program is called WYSE (Women
  and Youth Supporting Each Other), and it was focused on facilitating discussions about
  all sorts of things related to the students so whether it&rsquo;s career aspirations,
  puberty, relationships, women representation or racism and stuff like that. It&rsquo;s
  interesting because the middle school we were at is now shut down, and other schools
  are shutting down because of gentrification and companies coming in. They&rsquo;ll
  create their own new school, which feels counter-intuitive. Or they will go into these
  schools and create makerspaces, but then they are the same companies that are also
  pushing community members out based on rent prices and stuff like that. There is a lot
  going on, and it&rsquo;s not new to the Bay Area or to Silicon Valley. It&rsquo;s just
  more prevalent to me living in this area, and sometimes I forget about it because we
  are in a bubble. The same thing is happening all over the country."</p>

  <h2><strong>Closing Thoughts</strong></h2>

  <p>"I&rsquo;m really excited about a program I&rsquo;m in this year called seeds for
  change. It&rsquo;s basically a research center, but it&rsquo;s also a leadership
  program and mentorship activity. I get to mentor these female high school students, and
  we just discuss different strategies, and being a woman in STEM. With
  intersectionality, we talk about being women of color too. So different strategies in
  how to navigate certain things. I&rsquo;m really excited about the program because I
  learn and the students learn. It&rsquo;s a cool environment. "</p>
